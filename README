This is our open source RPG game that we plan to develop over the next couple semesters of our college career. The plan in to write the game in C#. Coding will be done by Derek Ness and Josh Frey. All graphics will be done by Derek Bitterman. In addition to these aspects, dialogue, story board, and battle mechanics are all a collaboration of the 3.
